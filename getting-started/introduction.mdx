### What is Videograph?

Videograph provides building blocks for on-demand and live video: ingest, transcode, delivery, and playback. It exposes capabilities through APIs and SDKs so you can upload media, start live streams, create clips, and deliver players to web and mobile.

⚠️ Missing info: Link to official product overview and pricing. Add URLs when available.

### What you can build

- Video-on-demand libraries with upload, processing, thumbnails, and playback.
- Live streaming with RTMP ingest and near‑real‑time delivery.
- FAST-style channels with server-side ad insertion.
- Clipping and highlights from live or archived content.
- Embedded players in web apps, CMSs, or mobile.

### Core concepts

- **Asset**: A stored piece of media (on-demand). Often created after upload.
- **Live stream**: A time-bound ingest that produces playable output.
- **Transcoding/processing**: Creating renditions and packaging for delivery.
- **Playback**: Delivering HLS/DASH or similar to a player.
- **Authentication**: API keys or tokens used to call protected endpoints.

This page explains concepts only. For steps, start with the tutorial in `getting-started/quickstart`.

### How this documentation is organized

- **Tutorial**: `getting-started/quickstart` — go from zero to a working outcome in under 20 minutes.
- **How‑to guides**: Focused tasks for a configured project (for example `getting-started/upload-your-first-video`, `getting-started/start-live-stream`).
- **Reference**: Canonical API facts live under the `API Reference` tab.
- **Explanation**: Concepts and tradeoffs (this page, plus `getting-started/auth-overview`).

### Prerequisites

You can read this page without setup. To execute tasks, you typically need:

- An account and API credentials. See `getting-started/setup-account-and-keys`.
- The CLI/SDK installed (optional but helpful). See `getting-started/installation`.

### Typical first path

1) Read this page to learn the terms. 2) Run the tutorial in `getting-started/quickstart`. 3) Continue with a task that matches your goal, such as `getting-started/upload-your-first-video` or `getting-started/start-live-stream`.

### UI paths (examples)

When UI steps are referenced, this style is used: `Settings → Projects → New`. Exact labels may differ based on your plan or permissions.
